# Inventory Selection Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Selecteer uit Rugzak" (Select from Backpack) button in the mission modal was not working - clicking it did nothing and blocked everything.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Complex event delegation was interfering with button clicks
2. Event propagation issues between modals
3. Timing issues with modal transitions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simplified Event Handling (guinea-pig-missions.js)
- Removed complex event delegation in `setupMissionModal()`
- Added direct event listener when modal is shown in `showMissionModal()`
- Used `cloneNode()` to ensure clean event listener attachment
- Added explicit button state management (disabled, pointerEvents, cursor)

### 2. Improved selectFromInventory Function
- Removed unnecessary delays
- Direct inventory opening without setTimeout
- Better error handling and logging
- Simplified flow: close mission modal â†’ open inventory immediately

### 3. Enhanced Button Setup in showMissionModal
```javascript
// Add direct event listener to button after modal is shown
setTimeout(() => {
    const inventoryBtn = document.getElementById('selectFromInventory');
    if (inventoryBtn) {
        // Remove any existing listeners first
        const newBtn = inventoryBtn.cloneNode(true);
        inventoryBtn.parentNode.replaceChild(newBtn, inventoryBtn);
        
        // Add fresh listener
        newBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopPropagation();
            console.log('Button clicked - opening inventory');
            this.selectFromInventory();
        });
        
        // Ensure button is not disabled
        newBtn.disabled = false;
        newBtn.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
        newBtn.style.cursor = 'pointer';
    }
}, 50);
```

## Testing
Created test-inventory-fix.html for easy testing:
1. Start the game
2. Go to "Thuis" (Home) world
3. Click on a guinea pig to open mission
4. Click "Selecteer uit Rugzak" - should now open inventory
5. Select items from inventory to complete missions

## Additional Improvements
- Added debug functions for testing
- Better console logging for troubleshooting
- Ensured proper z-index hierarchy (inventory modal: 2100 > mission modal: 2000)

The issue should now be resolved. The button will respond to clicks and properly transition from the mission modal to the inventory modal.
