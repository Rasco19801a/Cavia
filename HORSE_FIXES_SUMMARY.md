# Horse Mission Modal and Name Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Empty Mission Modals for Horses**
   - Problem: Horse mission modals were showing up empty
   - Cause: The `AnimalChallenge` class was using its own modal implementation instead of the centralized `MissionManager`
   - Fix: Updated `AnimalChallenge` to use `MissionManager` for consistent modal handling

2. **Missing Horse Names in Horse World**
   - Problem: Horse names were not visible in the paarden world
   - Cause: The `drawGuineaPigStyleAnimal` function was using undefined variables `screenX` and `screenY` for name rendering
   - Fix: Changed to use the correct `worldX` and `worldY` parameters

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `animals.js`:
- Modified `AnimalChallenge` constructor to create a `MissionManager` instance
- Updated `showMissionModal` to use `MissionManager.showMission()` with proper data structure
- Fixed `drawGuineaPigStyleAnimal` to use `worldX` and `worldY` for name rendering

### 2. Updated `mission-manager.js`:
- Added `isMissionModalVisible()` method
- Added `updateMissionProgress()` method
- Updated `updateModalContent()` to handle horse missions with proper icon (üê¥)

### 3. Updated `inventory.js`:
- Changed horse mission modal updates to use `MissionManager` methods

## Testing

Created `test-horse-fixes.html` to verify:
1. Horse names are displayed correctly in the canvas
2. Mission modals open with proper content
3. Mission modals show horse-specific information

## Result

Both issues are now fixed:
- Horse mission modals display correctly with all information
- Horse names are visible below each horse in the paarden world
