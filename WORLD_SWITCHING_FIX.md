# World Switching Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When switching from the home world ("thuiswereld") to another world, the top part of the home world remained visible on screen. This created a visual glitch where elements from the previous world would overlap with the new world.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Canvas Transform State**: The canvas transform matrix was not being properly reset before clearing the canvas, which could cause clearing operations to miss certain areas.

2. **Missing Building Class**: The `Building` class was being used but not defined, causing potential rendering issues with the home world's transparent building.

3. **Context State Management**: The drawing context state needed to be explicitly reset when switching between worlds.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Transform Reset in Draw Method
Added `ctx.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)` before clearing the canvas in the `draw()` method:
```javascript
// Reset transform before clearing to ensure we clear the entire canvas
this.ctx.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);

// Clear canvas
this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
```

### 2. Transform Reset in World Change
Added transform reset in the `changeWorld()` method to ensure clean state:
```javascript
// Reset canvas transform before changing worlds
this.ctx.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);
```

### 3. Added Missing Building Class
Created the `Building` class that was being referenced but not defined:
```javascript
class Building {
    constructor(x, y, w, h, color, name, type) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.w = w;
        this.h = h;
        this.color = color;
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.door = null;
    }
    
    draw(ctx) {
        if (this.color !== 'transparent') {
            ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
            ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.h);
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test files:
- `test-world-switching.html` - Debug tool for world switching
- `test-world-switching-fix.html` - Automated test suite

## Results
The fix ensures that:
1. The canvas is completely cleared when switching worlds
2. No visual artifacts remain from the previous world
3. The transform matrix is in a known state before each draw operation
4. Buildings are properly instantiated and can be rendered correctly

The issue should now be resolved, with smooth transitions between all worlds without any visual glitches.
