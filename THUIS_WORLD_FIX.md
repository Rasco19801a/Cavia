# Thuis World Movement & Visibility Fix

## Problem Description
In the thuis (home) world:
1. The player could not move
2. The player was not visible or very small

## Root Causes

### 1. Movement Blocked
The thuis world was created with a transparent building that covered the entire screen (0, 0, CONFIG.WORLD_WIDTH, CONFIG.WORLD_HEIGHT). This caused every click to be interpreted as a click on a building, preventing player movement.

### 2. Player Visibility
The player was being drawn at a small scale (0.5) which made it hard to see, especially in the detailed thuis world environment.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Removed Blocking Building
Changed `createThuisBuildings()` to return an empty array:
```javascript
export function createThuisBuildings() {
    // Return empty array - thuis world doesn't need buildings
    // The world is drawn directly in drawThuis function
    return [];
}
```

### 2. Increased Player Scale
Made the player larger in the thuis world for better visibility:
```javascript
// Use larger scale in thuis world for better visibility
const playerScale = this.currentWorld === 'thuis' ? 0.7 : 0.5;
this.player.draw(this.ctx, playerScale);
```

Also increased player scale in interiors:
```javascript
this.player.draw(this.ctx, 0.7); // Use larger scale in interiors
```

## Results
- Player can now move freely in the thuis world by clicking
- Player is more visible with the larger scale (0.7 instead of 0.5)
- The thuis world still renders correctly with all its furniture and decorations
- No invisible barriers blocking movement

## Testing
Created `test-thuis-world.html` for debugging and verifying:
- Player movement
- Player visibility
- Click handling
- World transitions
